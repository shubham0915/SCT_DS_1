A modern Python project to analyze and visualize global population data for the year 2023 using a vibrant and detailed histogram and boxplot. This project processes the dataset `Mydataset.csv` to provide insightful statistics, visualizations, and rankings of countries by population.

---

## üìã Project Overview

This project analyzes population data for 266 countries/regions in 2023, sourced from `Mydataset.csv`. The script (`TASK1.py`) generates a colorful and detailed visualization of population distribution, including a histogram with a KDE curve and a boxplot to highlight outliers. It also provides summary statistics and rankings of the top and bottom 5 countries by population. The project was developed and tested as of **04:43 PM IST on Tuesday, June 10, 2025**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **üìä Vibrant Visualizations**:
  - A colorful histogram with gradient bars (using the `Spectral` colormap) and a red KDE curve.
  - A matching boxplot in light coral, highlighting population outliers.
  - Both plots display population in millions, with bold labels and a professional design.

- **üìà Detailed Statistics**:
  - Summary statistics including mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles, and more.
  - Rankings of the top 5 and bottom 5 countries by population in 2023.

- **üõ†Ô∏è Easy to Use**:
  - Simple setup with clear instructions for running the script.
  - Dependencies are well-documented with installation steps.

- **üé® Modern Design**:
  - Uses Seaborn and Matplotlib for a polished, professional look with a light gray background and subtle gridlines.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Mydataset.csv`, which contains population data for 266 countries/regions from 1960 to 2024. Key details:

- **Structure**:
  - Columns: `Country Name`, `Country Code`, `Indicator Name`, `Indicator Code`, `1960`, `1961`, ..., `2023`, `2024`.
  - Delimiter: Comma (`,`).
  - Total Rows: 266 (one per country/region).

- **Data for 2023**:
  - Extracted and analyzed population figures for the year 2023.
  - Example data:
    - China: 1,412,175,000
    - Tuvalu: 9,816

The dataset is included in the repository for convenience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13 or higher.
- A terminal or IDE to run the script (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shubham0915/global-population-analysis-2023.git
   cd global-population-analysis-2023
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   The script requires the following Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `tabulate`. Install them using `pip`:
   ```bash
   /usr/local/bin/python3.13 -m pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn tabulate
   ```

3. **Verify Dataset**:
   Ensure `Mydataset.csv` is present in the project directory. The script assumes the dataset is comma-delimited. If your dataset uses a different delimiter, update the `sep` parameter in `pd.read_csv` in `TASK1.py`.

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script using Python 3.13:
   ```bash
   /usr/local/bin/python3.13 TASK1.py
   ```

2. **Expected Output**:
   - **Debug Output**: Lists the column names of the dataset to verify correct loading.
   - **Visualization**: A figure with two subplots:
     - **Histogram**: Shows the distribution of population sizes with gradient bars, a red KDE curve, and a median line.
     - **Boxplot**: Displays the spread of population sizes with outliers marked.
   - **Summary Statistics**: A table with detailed statistics (mean, median, etc.).
   - **Rankings**: Tables listing the top 5 and bottom 5 countries by population.

## üìä Results

### Visualization
The script generates a figure with a histogram and boxplot, both styled with a modern, colorful design:

- **Histogram**:
  - Gradient bars using the `Spectral` colormap.
  - Red KDE curve overlay.
  - Orange dashed line marking the median population (5.9M).

- **Boxplot**:
  - Light coral color with red outlier dots.
  - Shows the spread of population sizes, highlighting outliers like China and India.

## üí° Interesting Fact

The largest population in 2023 (China, 1.41 billion) is over **144,000 times larger** than the smallest (Tuvalu, 9,816). This extreme disparity highlights the challenges in global population studies, where a few countries dominate the total population while many others contribute minimally.

---

## üìù Conclusion

This analysis reveals a highly skewed population distribution in 2023, with a few countries like China and India having massive populations, while most countries have far smaller populations (median: 5.9 million). The visualizations effectively illustrate this skewness, and the statistics provide a comprehensive view of global population trends. This project serves as a foundation for further exploration, such as analyzing historical population growth or regional differences.
